### Getting the Code

Android development is only supported on Linux.

  1. Install [prerequisite software][1]

  2. Create a working directory, enter it, and run:

     ~~~~~ bash
     fetch --nohooks webrtc_android
     gclient sync
     ~~~~~

This will fetch a regular WebRTC checkout with the Android-specific parts
added. Notice that the Android specific parts like the Android SDK and NDK are
quite large (~8 GB), so the total checkout size will be about 16 GB.
The same checkout can be used for both Linux and Android development since you
can generate your [Ninja][4] project files in different directories for each
build config.

See [Development](/native-code/development/) for instructions on how to update
the code, building etc.

### Compiling

  1. Generate projects using GN.

     Make sure your current working directory is src/ of your workspace.
     Then run:

     ~~~~~ bash
     gn gen out/Debug --args='target_os="android" target_cpu="arm"'
     ~~~~~

     You can specify a directory of your own choice instead of `out/Debug`,
     to enable managing multiple configurations in parallel.

      * To build for ARM64: use `target_cpu="arm64"`
      * To build for 32-bit x86: use `target_cpu="x86"`
      * To build for 64-bit x64: use `target_cpu="x64"`

  2. Compile using:

     ~~~~~ bash
     ninja -C out/Debug
     ~~~~~

### Using the Bundled Android SDK/NDK

In order to use the Android SDK and NDK that is bundled in
`third_party/android_tools`, run this to get it included in your `PATH` (from
`src/`):

~~~~~ bash
. build/android/envsetup.sh
~~~~~

Then you'll have `adb` and all the other Android tools in your `PATH`.


### Running the AppRTCMobile App

AppRTCMobile is an Android application using WebRTC Native APIs via JNI (JNI
wrapper is documented [here][2]).

For instructions on how to build and run, see
[webrtc/examples/androidapp/README][3].


### Using Android Studio

  1. Build the project normally (out/Debug should be the directory you used when
     generating the build files using GN):

     ~~~~~ bash
     ninja -C out/Debug AppRTCMobile
     ~~~~~

  2. Generate the project files:

     ~~~~~ bash
     build/android/gradle/generate_gradle.py --output-directory $PWD/out/Debug \
     --target "//webrtc/examples:AppRTCMobile" --use-gradle-process-resources \
     --split-projects --canary
     ~~~~~

  3. *Import* the project in Android Studio. (Do not just open it.) The project
     is located in `out/Debug/gradle`. If asked which SDK to use, choose to use
     Android Studio's SDK. When asked whether to use the Gradle wrapper, press
     "OK".

  4. Ensure target `webrtc > examples > AppRTCMobile` is selected and press Run.
     AppRTCMobile should now start on the device.

If you do any changes to the C++ code, you have to compile the project using
ninja after the changes (see step 1).

*Note: Only "arm" is supported as the target_cpu when using Android Studio. This
still allows you to run the application on 64-bit ARM devices. x86-based devices
are not supported right now.*


### Running WebRTC Native Tests on an Android Device

To build APKs with the WebRTC native tests, follow these instructions.

  1. Ensure you have an Android device set in Developer mode connected via
     USB.

  2. Compile as described in the section above.

  3. To see which tests are available: look in `out/Debug/bin`.

  4. Run a test on your device:

     ~~~~~ bash
     out/Debug/bin/run_modules_unittests
     ~~~~~

  5. If you want to limit to a subset of tests, use the `--gtest_filter flag`,
     e.g.

     ~~~~~
     out/Debug/bin/run_modules_unittests \
     --gtest_filter=RtpRtcpAPITest.SSRC:RtpRtcpRtcpTest.*
     ~~~~~

  6. **NOTICE:** The first time you run a test, you must accept a dialog on
     the device!

If want to run Release builds instead; pass `is_debug=false` to GN (and
preferably generate the projects files into a directory like `out/Release`).
Then use the scripts generated in `out/Release/bin` instead.


### Running WebRTC Instrumentation Tests on an Android Device

The instrumentation tests (like AppRTCMobileTest and
libjingle_peerconnection_android_unittest) gets scripts generated in the same
location as the native tests described in the previous section.
